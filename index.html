      <p class="medium">This website is the data companion to the paper <a href="surfaces.pdf" class = "blue" target="_blank">Surfaces Associated to Zeros of
          Automorphic L-functions</a><a class="citation" href="ref.html"  >[1]</a> by Debmayla Basak, Cruz Castillo and
        Alexandru Zaharescu. The blue text above is a link to the preprint. 
        It is recommended to have a copy of the paper on hand while looking through this website. 
        <br>
        <br> In this website, you will find a description of our data, visualizations related to the pair and the triple
        correlation of the zeros of certain $L$-functions, and tables of moments. Simply click on the corresponding tab
        above to see any of this data. To compute our data for $\zeta(s)$, we use the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ found on <a class ="blue"
        href="https://www.lmfdb.org/zeros/zeta/" target = "_blank">LMFDB</a><a class="citation" href="ref.html">[2]</a> which were
      computed by Platt <a class="citation" href="ref.html">[6]</a>. For the other $L$-functions, we use
      Rubinstein's $L$-function calculator <a  class= "blue" href="https://github.com/agrawroh/l-calc" target = "_blank">lcalc</a><a
        class="citation" href="ref.html">[7]</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As an example, we include an animation on the right of the unnormalized version of a discrete approximation of the Pair
        Correlation Surface generated from the zeros of $\zeta(s).$ 
        In red, we have plotted Montgomery's $F(\alpha)$ function and 500 density histograms generated from the inner sum of Montgomery's $F(\alpha)$ function<a href ="\ref.html" class = "citation">[4]</a>.
        As you can see, the surface appears to a bell curve led along Montgomery's $F(\alpha)$ function. For more information on the data, please see the description tab.
